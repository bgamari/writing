### Goldner group: Experimental biophysics

In Lori Goldner's group I am working to broaden the applicability of
FÃ¶rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) as a tool to probe biomolecular
systems. With this tool, I examine the geometry and flexibility of
nucleic acid polymers such as DNA and RNA.

Building off of existing tools developed by Goldner at NIST, we
use colloidal droplets as a means of containment for fluorescently
labelled molecules. By way of a novel particle tracking system, we can
observed single-molecules contained within a droplet for minutes at
time, greatly extending the timescales accessible to fluorescence
spectroscopy.

By applying tools developed in the fields of statistics and machine
learning, I seek to draw more meaningful and efficient inferences from
experimental data. I use probabilistic graphical models along with
Bayesian inference to construct generative models of experimental
data. This generative modelling approach enables me to account for a
variety of phenomena in a principled yet computationally tractable
manner.

While FRET techniques provide a useful view into the slow fluctuations
and large changes of a molecule, resolution of fast dynamics,
particularly of the fluorophores themselves, is well beyond the
abilities of the technique. These dynamics can often have
significant implications on the information content of a
molecule's dynamics found in data. We employ atomistic molecular
dynamics simulations to shed light on these fast processes, allowing
us to more effectively understand the applicability of our inferences.

I feel that open access to hardware and software is essential for an
open and reproducible scientific dialogue. For this reason, I have
designed and implemented an inexpensive yet flexible hardware
[time-tagger](http://goldnerlab.physics.umass.edu/wiki/FpgaTimeTagger)
built around an off-the-shelf FPGA for use in single-photon counting
applications. The design and associated software is available under an
open-source license and serves as the primary data acquisition
platform for my experimental work.

## Previous work

### Independent: Extraction of friend's shared tastes from social networks

With [Dr. Laura Dietz](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~dietz/), I
developed a scalable Gibbs sampling framework and implemented and
compared several topic models. Furthermore, we demostrated a
substantial improvement in model performance by incorporating
friendship network structure.

### Alexandru group: Lattice quantum chromodynamics

With
[Dr. Andrei Alexandru](http://departments.columbian.gwu.edu/physics/people/138)
I developed a novel code base to greatly accelerate numerical
calculation of lattice quantum chromodynamics. This included,

  * Implement a variety of optimized kernels for common linear algebra
    operations, along with testing framework
  * Devise and implement an optimized implementation of the Wilson
    d-slash operator for nVidia's Fermi architecture, accomplishing a
    factor of 30 improvement in per-package runtime over existing
    optimized CPU implementations
  * Adapt implementation of eigensystem-solver
  * Generalize the code-base to operate across a cluster of GPUs

### Reeves group: Expermental condensed matter

During my work in Dr. Mark Reeves'
[group](http://www.gwu.edu/~condmat/CME/reeves.html) I worked to
implement a laser ablation technique (via
[MALDI](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/MALDI)) on length scales below
the diffraction limit. This work involved,
  
  * Development and optimization of protocols for near-field tip
    production from chalcogenide fiber
  * Characterization and optimization of atomic force microscope
    behavior while measuring soft media
  * Integration of a variety of laboratory equipment for positioning,
    mass spectroscopy, and laser excitation.
