# Research Agenda

### Goldner group: Experimental biophysics

In Lori Goldner's group I am working to broaden the applicability of
FÃ¶rster Resonance Energy Transfer as a tool to probe biomolecular
systems.

Building off existing tools developed by Goldner at NIST, we are seeking to
use droplets as a means of containment for fluorescent species. With a
tracking system developed by me, we can track single-molecules
contained within a droplet for minutes at time, greatly extending the
timescales accessible by fluorescence spectroscopy.

By applying tools developed in the fields of statistics
and machine learning, we can draw more meaningful and efficient
inferences from experimental data. To account for the wide breadth of
dynamics observed in biomolecular systems, we use

## Previous work

### Independent: Extraction of friend's shared tastes from social networks

With [Dr. Laura Dietz](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~dietz/), I
developed a scalable Gibbs sampling framework and implemented and
compared several topic models. Furthermore, we demostrated a
substantial improvement in model performance by incorporating
friendship network structure.

### Alexandru group: Lattice quantum chromodynamics

With
[Dr. Andrei Alexandru](http://departments.columbian.gwu.edu/physics/people/138)
I developed a novel code base to greatly accelerate numerical
calculation of lattice quantum chromodynamics. This included,

  * Implement a variety of optimized kernels for common linear algebra
    operations, along with testing framework
  * Devise and implement an optimized implementation of the Wilson
    d-slash operator for nVidia's Fermi architecture, accomplishing a
    factor of 30 improvement in per-package runtime over existing
    optimized CPU implementations
  * Adapt implementation of eigensystem-solver
  * Generalize the code-base to operate across a cluster of GPUs

    operator on multi-GPUs"

### Reeves group: Expermental condensed matter

During my work in Dr. Mark Reeves'
[group](http://www.gwu.edu/~condmat/CME/reeves.html) I worked to
implement a laser ablation technique (via
[MALDI](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/MALDI)) on length scales below
the diffraction limit. This work involved,
  
  * Development and optimization of protocols for near-field tip
    production from chalcogenide fiber
  * Characterization and optimization of atomic force microscope
    behavior while measuring soft media
  * Integration of a variety of laboratory equipment for positioning,
    mass spectroscopy, and laser excitation.
