Building kernel with following script,

    #!/bin/bash

    set -o errexit

    makeopts="ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi- $MAKEOPTS"

    make $makeopts all
    make $makeopts uImage
    make $makeopts modules
    cp arch/arm/boot/uImage /media/boot/uImage
    sudo make $makeopts modules_install MOD_INSTALL_PATH=/media/rootfs
    echo "Syncing..."
    sync
    echo "Done."
    exit 0

Beagleboard thinks it only has 16M of memory with both v3.0 and v2.6.39
kernels,

Resulting in OOM pretty early in boot.
Yet bootloader realizes correct amount,

    OMAP3630/3730-GP ES2.0, CPU-OPP2, L3-165MHz, Max CPU Clock 1 Ghz
    OMAP3 Beagle board + LPDDR/NAND
    I2C:   ready
    DRAM:  512 MiB
    NAND:  0 MiB
    MMC:   OMAP SD/MMC: 0

Passing `mem=512M` to kernel doesn't help.

Perhaps problem is in devicetree.
Downloaded `dtc` from `git://git.jdl.com/software/dtc.git` since version in kernel
tree (in `scripts/dtc`) doesn't build. Decoded devicetree,

    [1125 ben@ben-laptop dtc(master)] $ ./dtc -I dtb -O dts /media/boot/board.dtb 
    DTC: dtb->dts  on file "/media/boot/board.dtb"
    /dts-v1/;

    / {
            #address-cells = <0x1>;
            #size-cells = <0x1>;
            model = "TI OMAP3 BeagleBoard";
            compatible = "ti,omap3-beagle";

            chosen {
            };

            aliases {
            };

            memory {
                    device_type = "memory";
                    reg = <0x0 0x0>;
            };
    };

Hmm, not sure what this means. Where is actual devicetree source for the
beagleboard? Googling turns up many recent mentions
<https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/932472/> of arch/arm/boot/dts in kernel
tree, but this does not exist in v2.6.39 nor v3.0. It seems like the devicetree
branch of a [random repository](http://git.secretlab.ca/?p=linux-2.6.git;a=tree;f=arch/arm/boot/dts;h=714ec4bce2c5ff54a0873a67977758c1efd91a97;hb=refs/heads/devicetree/arm)
has this directory with an omap3-beagle.dts. It includes `skeleton.dtsi` which
claims that the bootloader will populate the memory node,

    /*
        * Skeleton device tree; the bare minimum needed to boot; just include and
        * add a compatible value.  The bootloader will typically populate the memory
        * node.
        */

    / {
            #address-cells = <1>;
            #size-cells = <1>;
            chosen { };
            aliases { };
            memory { device_type = "memory"; reg = <0 0>; };
    };

Perhaps I built a kernel without devicetree support. Judging by the Linaro
devicetree HOWTO(https://wiki.linaro.org/Resources/HowTo/KernelDeviceTree)
v2.6.39 doesn't support devicetrees (`CONFIG_USE_OF` doesn't exist). Checkout
v3.0. Ahh, I saved my original v3.0 .config and indeed CONFIG_USE_OF isn't set.
Damn. I wonder how the bootloader passed the memory amount to the kernel prior
to devicetrees. Apparently this mechanism doesn't work if the bootloader is
configured to use devicetrees.

After enabling `CONFIG_USE_OF` the machine hangs after "Uncompressing Linux...
done, booting the kernel." Bah.

Ahhh, after chatting with landley in Freenode's `#edev` I realized that `CONFIG_EARLY_PRINTK`
isn't enabled. It's hidden behind `CONFIG_LL_DEBUG` in the Kernel Hacking
category.

Bingo! I have an error message,

    Uncompressing Linux... done, booting the kernel.

    Please check your kernel config and/or bootloader.

Hmm, now what does that mean? 

It seems that the `machine_desc` (defined in the board file) should provide a
`dt_compat` list which defines the devicetree compatibility tags which that board
file can boot. This isn't defined in v3.0's `board-omap3beagle.c`. Looking at the
Linaro tree it appears these were added in 9d51c816. Cherry-picked.

It Works!
