# GHC-LLVM compatibility tests

Here are results from a series of compatibility tests of GHC's LLVM
backend.  See the
[main article](/posts/2014-11-28-state-of-llvm-backend.html) for
conclusions.

These were taken on an x86-64 EC2 instance running Ubuntu
14.04.1 LTS.

## LLVM 3.5, GHC 7.8.3 with rework, internal symbols
